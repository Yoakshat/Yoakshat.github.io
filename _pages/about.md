Hey, I am Akshat! This is my second iteration on this bio, and it's chaotic. I like to be a fun, crazy, chaotic guy, sometimes 
diving into the math of how the world works to different deep learning algorithms. Often thinking about healthcare. Stroking my beard is a nice 
pasttime, playing Call of Duty while stroking my beard is even better!

And just to call it out, I was in the AI field long before the AI trend started, though not as long as when Yann Lecun 
put out his infamous paper on Convolutional Neural Networks (I'd be in single-digits). And I don't have a favorite
subreddit even though that's one of the main things this Jekyll theme wants me to put, but whatever. Yay!
