Hey, I am Akshat or Yoakshat! Hopefully I didn't just give up my password to most sites, luckily it's a variation 
of Yoakshat with characters and numbers (that you can't guess)! Anyways, I love programming Artificial Intelligence, reading and writing even though I haven't read a full book end to end (like most highschoolers) in a long time, and thinking about healthcare. 

Just to call it out, I was in the AI field long before the AI trend started, though not as long as when Yann Lecun 
put out his infamous paper on Convolutional Neural Networks (I'd be in single-digits). I am a teenager, almost technically adult, and fortunately I'm still a Junior because of a technicality (yay I guess)! I don't have a favorite
subreddit even though that's one of the main things this Jekyll theme wants me to put, but whatever.
