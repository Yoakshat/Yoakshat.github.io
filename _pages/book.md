<h3>Description</h3>


A brilliant guide for high-schoolers and college math-enthusiasts, who wish to take math beyond the confines of the classroom and world of competition math, towards real innovation in healthcare. Written by an AIME qualifier, a health-AI researcher, a person who has interviewed dozens of world-renowned health-tech leaders, Akshat Mundra.

His goal is not to list all the applications of AI in healthcare, but make you keenly interested and enthusiastic about the beauty of the world of math, data science, and healthcare. Over and over again, school teaches with the assumptions that we're all interested in the same things, we have to follow a set curriculum, and everything on the test has to be taught.

This book doesn't aim to teach you everything that's going to be on a test, it aims to make you excited about this world of math, data science, and healthcare. It gives you the freedom to explore!

In The World Doesn't Wait For You you'll become well-versed in
- How to 'draw on a whiteboard' in healthcare, like world-renowned Kaggle data scientists do
- How to have crazy ideas and build data science applications that apply to your life NOW
- Where world-renowned leaders of healthcare are innovating in
- Learning the math behind neural networks via a game of Mario
    
You might have shrugged off healthcare as a boring topic a while ago, but overnight, your mind will keep going back to healthcare as the most exciting topic you've heard in a long time. Become excited!
