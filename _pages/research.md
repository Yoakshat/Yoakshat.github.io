    <h3>An Intro</h3>
    <p>Hospitals can benefit from Artificial Intelligence with tasks like predicting if a patient is going to be readmitted or not. For example, if a model outputs yes to be readmitted, hospitals may choose to schedule a primary care visit within a week. This helps both care outcomes and makes sure the hospital is running efficiently. No longer, will that readmitted patient take extra space in the intensive care unit (ICU)!

Using discharge summaries, many machine learning models have been 
trained on this task. However, often these summaries are templated. These models
may be learning template patterns which shouldn't have any impact on if a patient is readmitted or not. What happens if we remove these templates?</p>
